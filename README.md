## Abstract 
Background: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a prevalent, sensorimotor sleep disorder that is temporarily relieved by movement. Despite current evidence for the benefits of exercise in RLS, inter-individual variation in the response to exercise may exist, whereby some people experience physiological changes associated with exercise (i.e., responders) while others do not (i.e., non-responders). The present study examined inter-individual factors that may account for differences in the perceived response to exercise as a mode of treatment for RLS symptoms.
Methods: Participants (N=528) completed a nationwide survey including items assessing RLS, physical activity and sedentary levels, and experiences with exercise and RLS. Participants were classified as perceived responders and non-responders. Perceived responders were sub-classified as positive responders (i.e., exercise improves RLS) and negative responders (i.e., exercise worsens RLS). 

Conclusions: The present study presents unique factors that might account for individual differences in the response to exercise. Such individual differences and specific attributes should be considered in exercise-based management to further optimize personalized treatment plans to prevent and manage symptoms in people with RLS.
